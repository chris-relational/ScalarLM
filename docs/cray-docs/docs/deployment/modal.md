# Modal

ScalarLM can be deployed on Modal for easy access to GPUs.

Clone the [ScalarLM repository](https://github.com/tensorwavecloud/scalarlm) and start the server.

```console
git clone git@github.com:tensorwavecloud/scalarlm.git
cd cray
./cray deploy
```

Modal should give you an endpoint you can start using.
